            <h2>My Volunteer Work</h2>
            <p>I am a firm believer in giving back to the community that has taken care of me. At almost every point in my life, I have tried to volunteer and partake in services where my actions had a positive impact on others. No matter how big or small the event is or how large my role is, I still try to consistently give back. In recent semesters, I have had the opprotunity to be a Teaching Assistant and Peer Teacher, being able to assist professors and other Teaching Assistants in fostering a better learning enviroment for students of all backgrounds. I love and enjoy seeing the sense of accomplishment when students succeed and solve problems. I hope that my efforts and contributions have made a difference in people's lives. </p>
